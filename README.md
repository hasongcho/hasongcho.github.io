This project delves into the intricate dynamics of Chicago's taxi industry through three key questions. Firstly, it scrutinizes taxi demand trends across different pickup community areas from 2016 to 2022. Secondly, it investigates the influence of factors such as competition, unforeseen events, and internal strategy development on taxi demand. Lastly, it examines the relationship between trip duration and various factors like trip miles, time of day, month of year, and day of the week over a six-year period, providing insights into the underlying patterns driving trip duration variations in Chicago.
